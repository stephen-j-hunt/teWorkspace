    /**
     * You are given an input array of integers. Write a function to remove any duplicate
     * numbers from the input array
     *
     *  for example, given array:
     *
     *  [2, 3, 1, 8, 4, 8, 5, 1, 9, 8, 6]
     *
     *  the function returns:
     *
     *  [2, 3, 1, 8, 4, 5, 9, 6]
     *
     *  Provide 2 implementations for this function:
     *      A) - The unique numbers in the returned array can be in ANY order
     *      (easier case).
     *      Implement inside removeDuplicates() function below.
     *
     *      B) - The unique numbers in the returned array must be in the SAME
     *      order as the input array (see example above).
     *      Implement inside removeDuplicatesPreserveOrder() function below.
     *
     *      NOTE: This kata is similar to a problem that you may get as a part of an interview assessment.
     *      To keep this exercise realistic, PLEASE DON'T SEARCH THE WEB FOR A COMPLETE SOLUTION TO
     *      REMOVING DUPLICATES FROM AN ARRAY.
