Bug 1
-----
Test that demonstrates problem:
    public void getTimesheetsByEmployeeId_returns_list_of_all_timesheets_for_employee() {
Expected output:
    assertTimesheetsMatch(TIMESHEET_1,timesheet.get(0));
    assertTimesheetsMatch(TIMESHEET_2, timesheet.get(1));
        -returns 2 timesheets
Actual output:
    assertTimesheetsMatch(TIMESHEET_1,timesheet.get(0));
    assertTimesheetsMatch(TIMESHEET_2, timesheet.get(1));
        -it only returns 1 timesheet
How did you fix this bug?
changed the if loop to a while loop so it iterates through all the timesheets

Bug 2
-----
Test that demonstrates problem:
    public void getTimesheetsByProjectId_returns_list_of_all_timesheets_for_project() {
Expected output:
    assertTimesheetsMatch(TIMESHEET_1, timesheets.get(0));
    assertTimesheetsMatch(TIMESHEET_2, timesheets.get(1));
    assertTimesheetsMatch(TIMESHEET_3, timesheets.get(2));
        -returns 3 timesheets with input of project_id
Actual output:
        -returns 2 timesheets with input of project_id
How did you fix this bug?
    -changed the "Where" in the query from "WHERE employee_id = ?"
    to "WHERE project_id = ?"
    -employee_id only returns 2 because there are only 2 employees
    -now returns 3 because there is 1 timesheet for each project_id

Bug 3
-----
Test that demonstrates problem:
        public void updated_timesheet_has_expected_values_when_retrieved() {
Expected output:
  assertTimesheetsMatch(timesheetToUpdate, retrieved);
-should update the timesheet we called for
Actual output:
billable returns false when it should be true
How did you fix this bug?
added "billable_hours =?" into the query and updated and added "updatedTimesheet.isBillable()," to the jdbc update statement

Bug 4
-----
Test that demonstrates problem:
        public void getBillableHours_returns_correct_total() {
Expected output:
        Assert.assertEquals("should return 1",0.0, getHours,0);
- sets the billable hours for project_id 2 and employee_id 2 to 0.0 hours
Actual output:
-billable hours returns with 2.0 hours
How did you fix this bug?
added "billable = ?" to the query so it determines if hours worked were billable (true or false)
